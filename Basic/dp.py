# A DP is an algorithmic technique which is usually based on a recurrent formula and one (or some) starting states
# A sub-solution of the problem is constructed from previously found ones. 
# faster running time than other techniques like backtracking, brute-force etc.

# 1. sub-problem: #how to find states #sub-functions
## sum i, index k 
## maximum cost, position
